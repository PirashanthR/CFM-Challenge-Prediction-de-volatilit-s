This repository contains my handing for the class presented by Stéphane Mallat "Face à la Malédiction de la Dimensionnalité".

I have worked on the CFM challenge: the goal is to predict the volatility between 2pm and 4pm knowing all the volatilies within a 5 mn interval between 9am and 2pm.

Code should be uploaded soon.
